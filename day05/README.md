# Day05 - `MyHashMap`

## Learning Goals

After completing this assignment you should be able to:
* Understand the key concepts of hashing
  * Understand hash functions and considerations when creating them
  * Understand how a hash map chooses which sub-map to place objects in
* Compare the efficiency of various hash map implementations
  * Understand how a hash map achieves average constant time
* Identify when using a hash map is effective

## Assignment

### Reading

- In *Think Algorithms*, read sections **14.5, 14.6, 15.4 and 15.5.**.

### Code

Write a couple of sentences describing the main purpose of a hash function.  Are there any requirements or limitations when hashing?

Finish the implementation of MyHashMap (ch. 15.3-15.4):
* Fill in the body of `containsKey`
* Fill in the body of `containsValue()`
* Fill in the body of `rehash()`

Briefly describe the key differences and improvements between MyLinearMap and MyHashMap?

## Problems

Fill in the missing functions in AirTrafficControl.java following the instructions in the file.
