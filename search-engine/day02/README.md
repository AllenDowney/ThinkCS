# Wikipedia Search Engine Project - Day02

## Due Date (Day02)

This project is split up over three assignments.  Day01 is due **Midnight, Feb. 20**.

## Assignment

### Prerequisites

Start by copying the `Index.java`, `TermCounter.java`, and `Crawler.java` files from search engine `day00/src` into your `day01/src` folder. Mark the `src` and `utils` folders as `Sources Root`.  To do this, right click on the `utils` and `src` folders in IntelliJ, select Mark Directory as, and then select Sources Root for `utils` and Test Sources Root for `tests`.

We do not provide test files for this homework. You will need to justify the correctness of your search engine components to your check-off NINJAs.

### Code

You will fill in the methods of WikiSearch.java to complete your search engine.  If you get stuck, refer to the optional reading section below.

In `WikiSearch.java`:

* `WikiSearch or(WikiSearch that)`
* `WikiSearch and(WikiSearch that)`
* `WikiSearch minus(WikiSearch that)`


### (Optional) Reading

If you get stuck during the implementation, you can read Chapter 22 in *Think Algorithms*.
