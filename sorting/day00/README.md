# Day 10 - Sorting, part 1

## Assignment

- In `BubbleSort.java`, `InsertionSort.java`, and `MergeSort.java`, implement `int[] sort(int[] array)`, which returns a sorted array, using the specified algorithm.
- In `MergeSort.java`, implement `int[] sort(int[] array)`, which returns a sorted array, and `void merge(int[] left, int[] right, int[] out)`, which merges `left` and `right` them into a new sorted array `out`.
- For each `sort` function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity in the comments. Also, detail the space complexity. Provide an explanation for each of the four complexities.
