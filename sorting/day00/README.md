# Sorting Day 1 - `BubbleSort`, `InsertionSort`, and `MergeSort`

## Learning Goals

By doing this assignment, you should be able to:
* Implement bubblesort
  * Justify its runtime
  * Justify its space complexity
* Understand the insertion sort algorithm:
  * Understand the benefit of a simplistic and slow sorting algorithm, and it's practical uses.
  * Justify its runtime
  * Justify its space complexity
* Understand the merge sort algorithm:
  * Understand the roles of the recursive split then merge steps
  * Justify its O(nlgn) runtime
  * Justify its O(n) space complexity, and be aware that it can run in O(1) space by using linked lists instead of arrays

## Assignment

### Code

- In `BubbleSort.java`, `InsertionSort.java`, implement `int[] sort(int[] array)`, which returns a sorted array, using the specified algorithm.
- In `MergeSort.java`, complete the methods annotated with `TODO`s so that `sort` runs; use (or not) the helper methods and method declarations we've provided for you.
- For each `sort` function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity in the comments. Also, detail the space complexity. Provide an explanation for each of the four complexities.

### Reading

- **required**: When you're done coding, in *Think Algorithms* read section **23.2** and **23.5**.
- **if you get stuck**: **23.3** and **23.4** contain implementations of insertion and merge sort. We encourage you to implement them without copying the book code.
