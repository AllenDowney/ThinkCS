# Sorting Day 0 - `BubbleSort`, `InsertionSort`, and `MergeSort`

## Learning Goals

By doing this assignment, you should be able to:
* Justify the listed runtime and space complexities of each sort
* Implement bubblesort
  * O(1) space
  * Best, worst, and average case O(N^2) time
* Understand the insertion sort algorithm:
  * Understand the benefit of a simplistic and slow sorting algorithm, and it's practical uses.
  * O(1) space
  * Worst and average case O(N^2) time
  * Best case O(N) time
* Understand the merge sort algorithm:
  * Understand the roles of the recursive split then merge steps
  * O(N) space
  * Worst, average, and best case O(NlogN) time
  
## Assignment

### Code

- In `BubbleSort.java`, `InsertionSort.java`, and `MergeSort.java`, complete the methods annotated with `TODO`s so that `sort` runs.
- For each `sort` function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity in the comments. Also, detail the space complexity. Provide a short, one to two sentence total explanation for the complexities.

### Reading

- **required**: When you're done coding, in *Think Algorithms* read section **23.2** and **23.5**.
- **if you get stuck**: **23.3** and **23.4** contain implementations of insertion and merge sort. We encourage you to implement them without copying the book code.
