# Sorting Day 1 - `QuickSort` and `HeapSort`

## Learning Goals

By doing this assignment, you should be able to

* Justify the listed runtime and space complexities of each sort
* Understand the quicksort algorithm:
  * Understand the role of partitioning around a pivot.
  * Understand how the algorithm recursively sorts the left and right partitions.
  * O(logN) space
  * Average and best case O(NlogN) time
  * Worst case O(N^2) time
* Understand the heap sort algorithm:
  * Use and understand the heap data structure: how it is used in the algorithm, and what augmentation it needs in order to implement a priority queue
  * O(1) space
  * Worst, average and best case O(NlogN) time

## Assignment

### Reading

- In *Think Algorithms*, read sections **23.4, 23.5 and 23.7**.

### Code

- For both `QuickSort.java` and `HeapSort.java`, complete the methods annotated with `TODO`s so that `sort` runs; use (or not) the helper methods and method declarations we've provided for you.

- For each sort function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity in the comments. Also, detail the space complexity. Provide an explanation for each of the four complexities.
