# Sorting Day 1 - Heaps and `HeapSort`

## Learning Goals

By doing this assignment, you should be able to

* Understand the heap sort algorithm:
  * Understand why building a heap is O(N) time
  * Understand why heap sort is worst, average and best case O(NlogN) time
  * Understand the O(1) space complexity of heap sort
* Understand how to implement a priority queue
  * How to implement it using a max-heap
  * O(1) space

## Assignment

### Reading

- In *Think Algorithms*, read sections **23.4, 23.5 and 23.7**.

### Code

- For both `QuickSort.java` and `HeapSort.java`, complete the methods annotated with `TODO`s so that `sort` runs; use (or not) the helper methods and method declarations we've provided for you.

- For each sort function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity in the comments. Also, detail the space complexity. Provide an explanation for each of the four complexities.
